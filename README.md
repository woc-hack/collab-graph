- team name: Collab-Graph
- Google meet / zoom room: https://meet.google.com/dsd-ohcj-xrf
- Working hours: late evenings (tentatively, 8 / 8:30 pm onwards) 

- Research questions: not questions, but deliverables:
1. Build a graph of collaboration between individuals across all OSS (Aggregate contributions per repository / file)
2. Build a usable and fun-to-explore tool (Static (?) web app with search and visualization) 
3. Provide a convenient way to work with the graph (Distribute a dump of a graph DB (e.g. neo4j))
