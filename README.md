### Research ideas:
1. Build a graph of collaboration between individuals across all OSS (Aggregate contributions per repository / file)
2. Build a usable and fun-to-explore tool (Static (?) web app with search and visualization) 
3. Provide a convenient way to work with the graph (Distribute a dump of a graph DB (e.g. neo4j))
